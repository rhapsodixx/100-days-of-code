# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn basic fundamental of React & React router from [scotch.io - react on the server for beginner](https://scotch.io/tutorials/react-on-the-server-for-beginners-build-a-universal-react-and-node-app).

I learn on how to use universal rendering with facebook react. I learn from their website and also from [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import). I found out that facebook react have a lot of magic function such as : Link.

However, the project is not running properly on my localhost. I got [error decoder](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=130&args[]=undefined&args[]=%20Check%20the%20render%20method%20of%20%60t%60).

**Thoughts:** My mind seems still occupied with mobile app development scope of thinking. I really need to empty my mind and learn new paradigm in modern Web Application Development.

### Day 1: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to use webpack and configure it for obfuscating and minifying using UglyJS. It seems some of the imported method is not imported properly. I wrote `import link from 'react-router'`, it should be written like this `import { link } from 'react-router'`.

**Thoughts:** Seems now i can focus and more open to new paradigm. Its a great feeling to accomplished the same result with the tutorials.

I need to proceed to the next tutorial, purchased one of modern web development course using react on udemy. Hey its cheap, only USD$10 : [the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/learn/v4/content).
